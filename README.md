# Employee-Leave-Management
Here, Employee has to log in and employee can easily apply for a leave. Admin has to approve or decline the leave request. Admin can add/manage leave type and add/manage employees.  This is a simple project done in PHP. It’s easy to operate and understand by users.The design is pretty simple and the user won’t find it difficult to understand, use and navigate.
